            Applux is run by Emerson Pourghaed, with the occasional assistance of other professionals that complement him in the field. The primary services that the group brings is web development, and Applux has members experienced in Mobile App Development, system administration and business solutions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Emerson first got into web development in middle school as a leisurely activity, creating static webpages with friends and designing CSS templates for message boards. He decide to pursue web development after using Python for descriptive statistic purposes, eventually leading to creating his first back end webpage using Flask. He has since broadened his skillset, and delivers sites for different occasions and purposes.
